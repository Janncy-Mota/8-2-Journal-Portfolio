The application I developed was designed to meet specific user needs by making task management simple and intuitive. My goal was to create a tool that users could easily navigate, helping them complete their tasks more efficiently. I wanted to ensure that the app addressed everyday challenges, streamlining processes and improving overall productivity, so users could get things done with minimal hassle. 

I’m proud of how well I structured the code. I focused on creating clear, reusable components, which not only made the development process smoother but also ensured that the application was easy to maintain and expand in the future. This approach helped keep the project organized and made it easier to troubleshoot and enhance as needed, setting a solid foundation for any future updates. 

When comparing the Console and WPF applications, the Console version was all about functionality, making sure the core features worked as intended. The WPF application, on the other hand, required a more thoughtful approach to the user experience. I focused on creating a visually appealing and intuitive interface, with clear screens and straightforward navigation. 

I kept the user in mind by prioritizing simplicity and ease of use, which made the design successful and user-friendly. I approached debugging and coding by breaking the application down into smaller, manageable pieces and testing each one individually. I used step-by-step debugging and unit testing to catch and fix issues early on. 

These techniques were effective in ensuring the application ran smoothly, and I plan to continue using them in future projects to maintain a high level of code quality and catch potential problems before they become major issues. During the development process, I encountered a particularly tricky bug that forced me to get creative. It wasn’t something that could be solved with a straightforward solution, so I had to step back and think about the problem from a different angle. After trying a few different approaches, I finally came up with a custom solution that worked. This experience reminded me of the importance of flexibility and persistence when coding, and it really pushed me to think outside the box to overcome challenges.
